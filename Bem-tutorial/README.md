BEM
====
BEM — Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components and code 
sharing in front-end development.

Introduction
============
BEM is a highly useful, powerful, and simple naming convention that makes your front-end code easier to read and understand, easier to work with, easier to scale, more robust and explicit, and a lot more strict.


Naming
======
The BEM approach ensures that everyone who participates in the development of a website works with a single codebase and speaks the same language. Using BEM’s proper naming convention will better prepare you for design changes made to your website.
